# Modelling Biological Switches using Differential Equations

During my integrated Masters in Mathematics at the University of Sheffield, I completed a year-long research project. My project was dedicated to the mathematical modelling behind biological switches. You may be thinking 
* What is a biological switch?
* Why are they important to biological processes?
* And how do you use mathematics to create these accurate models?

### *Introduction*

#### What is a Biological Switch? 
Decision-making mechanisms in biological systems are vital to the momentous events that occur every day in natural science. Biological systems are adapted to respond quickly to environmental changes through the use of an important mechanism, also referred to as a *biological switch.* This mechanism describes the response of a biological system given the occurrence of an event. In other words, the system adapts to a new scenario and consequently, its behaviour changes or rather it *switches.* The system reaches equilibrium, representing the completion of the decision, and carries on until another momentous event occurs.

#### Why are biological switches important? ####
The interactions in biological systems are vital to assess when understanding complex behaviours. By investigating these processes, it gives the ability to make predictions about dynamical features in biological systems and create more accurate mathematical models. Computational algorithms such as in-built differential equations solvers and other numerical techniques like the Milstein method, form the basis behind these models, and furthermore increase the computational speed when generating results.

### *Key Objectives*

Biological switch behaviour can easily be simulated in Python using various types of differential equations. What we are interested is how do parameters play a key part in changing the behaviour? Can we understand this in depth using mathemathical analysis and adapt this to a real-life biological switch?

The key objectives for this investigation are as follows:
1. The use of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), delay differential equations (DDEs), stochastic differential equations (SDEs), and stochastic delay differential equations (SDDEs) when modelling a biological switch.
2. The behaviour that is simulated with each model through useful visualisations such as Time Vs Concentration diagrams, nullclines, and phase portraits.
3. Using statistics and testing to form accurate conclusions from the data about two main characteristics of a biological switch: switching time and predictability of its end point.
